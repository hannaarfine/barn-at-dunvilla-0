Dunn purchased 160 acres and more than 2,500 feet of shoreline on Lake Lizzie from a homesteader for a mere forty-five dollars. At the turn of the century, he and his son, Roy, began to pursue their dream.  Tourists had recently discovered the lake region, popular for its abundance of fishing, hunting, and beautiful water features. They arrived in droves from throughout the midwest, camping along the shoreline, or even renting space in area haylofts.  The Dunns decided to build on the growing popularity of the region.  Their first cabin was built in 1908, with more to follow, eventually including two dozen cabins stretched along the Lake Lizzie shoreline.  The resort included docks, pavilions, and boats.
